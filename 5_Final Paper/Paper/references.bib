	abstract = {Reverse translation of polypeptide sequences to expressible mRNA constructs is a NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. Each amino acid in the protein sequence can be represented by as many as six codons, and the process of selecting the combination that maximizes probability of expression is termed codon optimization. This work investigates the potential impact of leveraging quantum computing technology for codon optimization. An adiabatic quantum computer (AQC) is compared to a standard genetic algorithm (GA) programmed with the same objective function. The AQC is found to be competitive in identifying optimal solutions and future generations of AQCs may be able to outperform classical GAs. The utility of gate-based systems is also evaluated using a simulator resulting in the finding that while current generations of devices lack the hardware requirements, in terms of both qubit count and connectivity, to solve realistic problems, future generation devices may be highly efficient.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

@article{Linke2017,
	abstract = {Quantum computers are an emerging technology promising to be vastly more powerful at solving certain problems than any conventional computer. These devices are now moving out of the laboratory and becoming generally programmable. This allows identical quantum tasks or algorithms to be implemented on radically different technologies to inform further development and scaling. We run a series of algorithms on the two leading platforms: trapped atomic ions and superconducting circuits. Whereas the superconducting system offers faster gate clock speeds and a solid-state platform, the ion-trap system features superior qubits and reconfigurable connections. The performance of these systems is seen to reflect the topology of connections in the base hardware, supporting the idea that quantum computer applications and hardware should be codesigned.We run a selection of algorithms on two state-of-the-art 5-qubit quantum computers that are based on different technology platforms. One is a publicly accessible superconducting transmon device (www.research.ibm.com/ibm-q) with limited connectivity, and the other is a fully connected trapped-ion system. Even though the two systems have different native quantum interactions, both can be programed in a way that is blind to the underlying hardware, thus allowing a comparison of identical quantum algorithms between different physical systems. We show that quantum algorithms and circuits that use more connectivity clearly benefit from a better-connected system of qubits. Although the quantum systems here are not yet large enough to eclipse classical computers, this experiment exposes critical factors of scaling quantum computers, such as qubit connectivity and gate expressivity. In addition, the results suggest that codesigning particular quantum applications with the hardware itself will be paramount in successfully using quantum computers in the future.},

	abstract = {We introduce Q-Nash, a quantum annealing algorithm for the NP-complete problem of finding pure Nash equilibria in graphical games. The algorithm consists of two phases. The first phase determines all combinations of best response strategies for each player using classical computation. The second phase finds pure Nash equilibria using a quantum annealing device by mapping the computed combinations to a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization formulation based on the Set Cover problem. We empirically evaluate Q-Nash on D-Wave's Quantum Annealer 2000Q using different graphical game topologies. The results with respect to solution quality and computing time are compared to a Brute Force algorithm and the Iterated Best Response heuristic.},

	abstract = {Scheduling problems have attracted the attention of researchers and practitioners for several decades. The quality of different methods developed to solve these problems on classical computers have been collected and compared in various benchmark repositories. Recently, quantum annealing has appeared as promising approach to solve some scheduling problems. The goal of this paper is to check experimentally if and how this approach can be applied for solving a well-known benchmark of the classical Job Shop Scheduling Problem. We present the existing capabilities provided by the D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealing system in the light of this benchmark. We have tested the quantum annealing system features experimentally, and proposed a new heuristic method as a proof-of-concept. In our approach we decompose the considered scheduling problem into a set of smaller optimization problems which fit better into a limited quantum hardware capacity. We have tuned experimentally various parameters of limited fully-connected graphs of qubits available in the quantum annealing system for the heuristic. We also indicate how new improvements in the upcoming D-Wave quantum processor might potentially impact the performance of our approach.},
